## Description

This is a to do list that contains some of implementations I would do with more time, this was a project that had to be built in 4 hours.

## Better sync with the team

I would config the tool called Husky and convetional commits to all members of project needed to use convetional commits as chore: feat: to better maintainability.

## User and login implementation

I would create an user model and table and some CRUD operations to access that user and do login implementation with JWT or some external
tool like firebase.
Also the signup functionality and login functionality.

## Better UX and UI

So I spent my majority of time available to implement the functionalities. So I would do a better layout using tailwindCSS and use the lib called Radix to better SEO.

## Componentization
Would do a better componentization of the inputs and files.  
As form group component and inside that would be the common input, textareas and buttons.
Would create folder called pages and that would be the page login  and the default page of listing all reminders.

## User Operation

So with Login implemented I would not let the user access reminders created by others used except in the case that this user is an ADMIN.
Therefore the user couldn't acess or do alterations on someone's reminders.

## Docker

I would create a Docker Compose file to run my project react application.

## Validation

I would use yup as a tool to provided better validation to the formik forms as common used in login forms and such.

## Tests

I woudld create tests using react-testing-library and cypress to full test the frontend simulating an user.

## Notifications

Using the lib toastify I would implement components of notifcations that provides better UX, if succeed in some operation or didn't.
